Python limb darkening testing code for gCMCRT. 

Samples a random transit chord on the transit annulus - projects it back onto the stellar disk,
then calculates directly the stellar zenith angle of the chord,
then calculates the "exact" limb darkening coefficent for that chord given a limb darkening law.
Then makes some neato plots for the number of samples
